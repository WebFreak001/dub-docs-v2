# Installing DUB

## Bundled with the compiler

DUB is being distributed alongside with [the major D compilers](https://dlang.org/download.html) whenever installing their full packages.

Once you have a D compiler installed, open the terminal and try running `dub --version` to see if DUB is installed.

## Standalone installation

DUB can be installed separately from the compiler, for example this may be necessary when a package manager is used to install just the compiler or when DUB needs to be updated separately from the compiler to make use of new features.

### Pre-compiled packages

Pre-compiled DUB binaries are available for x86 (32 and 64 bit) machines for Linux, OSX and Windows on the [GitHub DUB releases](https://github.com/dlang/dub/releases). Extract the archive anywhere on your system and make sure the DUB executable is in your path.

### From source

First clone the [dub repository](https://github.com/dlang/dub) from git:

```
git clone https://github.com/dlang/dub.git
```

If you already have another (perhaps older) DUB version installed, you can simply run

```
dub build
```

then, the dub executable will be inside the `bin` folder.

---

If you do not have a previous dub version to bootstrap from, use the `build.d` script in the repository's folder to build dub:

```
rdmd build.d
```

or directly with dmd or ldc:

```
dmd -run build.d
# or
ldc2 -run build.d
# or
gdc build.d && ./a.out
```
