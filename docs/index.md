DUB is the official package manager for [the D programming language](https://dlang.org), providing simple and configurable cross-platform builds. DUB is well integrated in various IDEs and can also generate configuration for third party build systems and IDEs.

Use the [DUB registry website](https://code.dlang.org) to discover packages and publish your own.

The [CLI](cli-reference/dub.md) can be used to

- download programs and dependencies ([dub fetch](cli-reference/dub-fetch.md), [dub upgrade](cli-reference/dub-upgrade.md))
- create projects ([dub init](cli-reference/dub-init.md), [dub add](cli-reference/dub-add.md))
- compile projects and external programs ([dub build](cli-reference/dub-build.md), [dub run](cli-reference/dub-run.md))
- test projects ([dub test](cli-reference/dub-test.md))
